**Dinogram** is a Telegram bot that can download public videos & photos from
social media platforms (TikTok & Instagram) and send them to a Telegram chat. To
use it, add the bot to a group or send it a direct message with a link to a post
and it will respond with the corresponding media items.

> [!NOTE]
> This public instance is for demonstration purposes only. Therefore, it might
> frequently run into rate limits of social media platforms, or into usage
> quotas set by cloud VM provider. For optimal results, it is recommended to
> self-host the bot. To learn more, refer to the `Deployment` section of this
> document.

Supported social media platforms:

- TikTok
  - Videos with captions are supported.
  - Photos with title, captions, and music are supported.
  - Posts that are private or require sign-in are NOT supported.
- Instagram
  - Reels and posts with mixed content (photos & videos) are supported.
  - Posts that are private or require sign-in are supported if authentication
    cookie is provided.
  - Instagram has severe rate limits for non-authenticated users: 200 requests
    per hour. Therefore, frequent errors caused by rate limits are to be
    expected.

Extra bot features:

> [!NOTE]
> ⚙️ denotes config keys (environment variables)
>
> 🗨️ denotes bot settings (`/settings` command in chat)

- Use authentication cookies provided in chat (🗨️) by pre-defined admin (⚙️:
  `BOT_ADMINS`)
- Automatically resend messages when hitting
  [flood control limits](https://grammy.dev/advanced/flood).
- Truncates long captions to avoid hitting the
  [max character count limit](https://limits.tginfo.me/en).
- Configurable reply behavior (⚙️:
  `WITH_CAPTION`,`SEND_AS_REPLY`,`SHOW_CAPTION_ABOVE_MEDIA`).
- Restrict bot access by user ID or chat ID (⚙️`WHITELIST`).
- Report errors to original chat (⚙️`SEND_ERRORS`) or pre-configured
  recipients(⚙️ `REPORT_ERRORS_TO`).
- Configurable
  [Bot API server](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#using-a-local-bot-api-server)
  URL (⚙️ `BOT_API_ROOT`). It can be used to increase max file size limit.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `@raw_data_bot` to get the user or chat ID

## 🔮 Future plans:

- TikTok Authentication (to access posts that require sign-in)
- Automated authentication
- Youtube videos
- Rate limiter (to give everyone a fair chance)

## 🚀 Deployment

Regardless of the deployment method, you need to obtain a token from the
[BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).

### Docker

One-liner with default configuration:

```sh
docker run ghcr.io/arslan-charyyev/dinogram:latest -e BOT_TOKEN=your:token
```

### Docker Compose

You may refer to [compose.prod.yml](./compose.prod.yml) for an example of
production deployment using docker compose.

> [!NOTE]
> Dinogram stores its runtime settings in a sqlite database file. By default the
> database file is created in deno's cache folder, which you can find by using
> the following command: `deno info | grep storage`. This folder can be changed
> using the `DATA_DIR` environment variable.
>
> The docker image uses the `DATA_DIR` variable to set this directory to
> `/app/data/`. To persist the data across container ups & downs, the
> `compose.prod.yml` file maps this directory to a docker volume.

## ⚙️ Config

There are 2 ways to configure the bot:

- via environment variables (during deployment)
- via bot settings (during operation)

### Environment variables

The only required config variable is the `BOT_TOKEN`. You can set either via a
`.env` file or via environment variables.

For the other config options and their descriptions, please refer to the
[config.ts](src/core/config.ts) file.

### Bot settings

These settings can be configured by sending the `/settings` command to the bot,
and changing them interactively.

## 🛠️ Development setup

### System requirements

- Linux / WSL<sup>(unverified)</sup>
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Optional)
- [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/quickstart/) (Optional)
- [x11vnc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11vnc) (If not using Devbox)

### First-time setup

- Clone this repository
- Initialize environment variables: `cp .template.env .env`
- Update `BOT_TOKEN` variable in the [.env](.env) file with your bot token.
- (If using Devbox) Run `devbox shell`

### Running the project

From terminal:
- (If using Devbox) Run `devbox shell`
- Run `deno task main`

From VS code (with full debugging support):
- Open the project directory in VS code
- Open command palette in VSCode (cmd+shift+p) and type: `Devbox: Reopen in Devbox shell environment`
- Press Enter and wait for VSCode to reload.
- Open the `▶️🐞 Run and Debug` panel
- Select the `main` configuration
- Hit the `Start debugging (F5)` button (▶️)

Testing the docker image:
- `docker compose up --build`

or, if using Devbox:

- `devbox run docker`

### Useful commands

```sh
deno task deps:cache # Download all dependencies
```

```sh
deno task main
```

```sh
deno task issues:check # Check project issues
```

```sh
deno task test:all # Run all tests
```

The following builds the Dinogram docker image and starts corresponding
container, alongside Bot API server.

```sh
devbox run docker
```

### Dependency considerations

Most libraries are fetched from `jsr` or `npm`. However, there are some
exceptions:

- `grammy` libraries are sourced from deno-land because sourcing them from npm
  breaks their typings.
